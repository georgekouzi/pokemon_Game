# Pokemon game.

### In this project we will represent a Pokemon game that works automatically.
----

At each stage selected in the game a display system will open which will display a map on which Pokemon trainers move on the rib editor and try to catch as many Pokemon thy possible.
The speed of the trainers changes as they catch more Pokemon.
Each Pokemon has a different score, when a trainer captures a Pokemon he accumulates the score of the same Pokemon.



#### How It Works:

1) You have 24 games (Between 0 and 23), each game different.
   The difference is:
* Each stage has its own map.
* The amount of Pokemon trainers varies from stage to stage.
* The amount of Pokemon to catch varies from stage to stage.

2) Once you have chosen which stage you want to play you need to put our id. 
then game will start running with a time limit - each game has its own time limit.
3) After the game is over or while you can see the results that each agent has accumulated and his transitions from node to node.
